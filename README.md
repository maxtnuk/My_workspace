this is the work space for programing

//this is just my review//

there is the important concept for rust
and finally i know it
it is the 'Tree of Resource'
resource have the branch and each program use this resource
this is verry important concept 
Thank you Rust!! my logical think is changed
it is fun to have time with rust!!  

//next review//

I studied the type object and it is hard to understand this concept
because i think reference is to just give the right to use resource
after thinking about that i realize that reference contains the not only
default type but also traits so it can use type object and type object have 
the variable type so it is able to dynamic dispatch
yeh it would be wrong concept so don't take it seriously 
but it would be helpful that comment about this concept by email
thank you for read this
