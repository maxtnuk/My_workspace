Rc<T>: refernce counted pointer this lets us have multiple owning pointers
	   to the same data, and the data will be dropped when all pointers 
	   are out of scope 
	   it is a viable alternative to &T
Weak<T>: this is a non-owning,but also non-borrowed,smart pointer
Cell<T>: type that provides zero-cost interior mutability
RefCell<T>: enforces the read write lock pattern at runtime
