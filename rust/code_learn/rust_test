rust provide the test tool
if we make the rust project in cargo i would see this function in lib.rs
'#[test]
fn it_works(){
}'
'#[test]' this attribute indicate that this is a test function
so if you use 'cargo test' then rust test the function and get the result
if function goes wrong, cargo will give the fail
(additionaly if function have #[should_panic],although function cause the 
panic, test said it is passed)
if you have function that want not to be tested then there #[ignore]
if you want confige the function then use #[cfg(any(),not(),all())]
cfg can also use as function like this
'if cfg!(target_os ="macos")||cfg!(target_os="ios")
{
	println!("Think Different!");
}'
