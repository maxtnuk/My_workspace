document is an important part of any software project
if you want to comment the program then use like this
'///somthing'
there are some rules to write document
///#Panics: it refer the Unrecoverable misuses of a function
///#Errors: it refer error
///#Safety: if you use the 'unsafe' then it will be better refer that
///#Example: show the example of function
and if you write the rust code on document then write like this
///'''
///println!("Hello,world");
///'''
if you use the another programing code use like this
///'''c
///printf("hello");
///'''
